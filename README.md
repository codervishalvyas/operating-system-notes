# Understanding Operating Systems

This repository is my personal knowledge base and hands-on notes as I explore the internal world of **Operating Systems** â€” the silent engine behind all computing.

# Operating System Notes

This repository contains a detailed collection of handwritten and typed notes covering the core concepts of **Operating Systems**. It is created as a personal learning resource and is shared publicly to help others studying or working in the field of computer science.

The notes are structured to gradually build understanding from basic concepts to more advanced topics. They aim to simplify complex ideas through clear explanations, real-world analogies, and where appropriate, diagrams or examples. Whether you're a student preparing for your exams, someone revising core CS concepts, or just curious about how operating systems work, this repository is made to assist your learning journey.

The motivation behind creating this repo was to consolidate all important Operating System topics in one place so that they can be accessed anytime, anywhere. Having personally struggled to find organized and exam-ready material, I started compiling these notes from various trusted academic resources, lectures, and books.

While these notes are initially written to aid in my BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) course, they are general enough to be useful for most undergraduate-level CS programs and interview preparation. They also serve as a quick refresher for anyone returning to the subject after a break.

**Note:** This repository will be updated continuously as I learn more or refine existing notes.

##  Basics about OS:-

An **Operating System (OS)** acts as an interface between the user and hardware. Its core roles:

- Managing CPU, memory, and I/O devices
- Handling processes, scheduling, and execution
- Providing user interaction (CLI/GUI)
- Ensuring file system and resource security

##  My Thoughts

> I explore **how and why** tools and systems work.  
> I believe understanding the **core concepts** leads to real growth.  
> I donâ€™t chase trends or money â€” I build, break, and learn out of **passion**.  
>  
> Developers are everywhere â€” but I strive to be one who builds **with purpose**, explores deeply, and shares consistently.
